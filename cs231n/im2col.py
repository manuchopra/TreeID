  """
  Convert a 4D array of independent 3D inputs into a single 2D array where each
  column is a receptive field of one of the inputs.

  The input x has shape (N, C, H, W); this should be interpreted as N
  independent inputs, each with height H, width H, and C channels.

  A receptive field of a single input is a rectangular block that spans all
  channels and whose height and width are given by field_height and field_width
  respectively. We imagine sliding these receptive fields over each of the
  inputs, where the horizontal and vertical offset between each receptive field
  is given by the stride parameter.

  Before extracting receptive fields, we also zero-pad the top, bottom,
  left, and right of each input with zeros.

  We will use this to efficiently implement convolution and pooling layers.

  As a simple example, we run the following matrix through im2col with
  field_height=field_width=2, padding=1, and stride=1:

  [1 2]
  [3 4]

  We would first pad the matrix with 0, giving the following:

  [0 0 0 0]
  [0 1 2 0]
  [0 3 4 0]
  [0 0 0 0]

  We would then slide a 2x2 window over this padded array, and reshape each
  window to a column, producing the following:

  [0 0 0 0 1 2 0 3 4] 
  [0 0 0 1 2 0 3 4 0]
  [0 1 2 0 3 4 0 0 0]
  [1 2 0 3 4 0 0 0 0]

  You should use the field_coords generator function from above to iterate over
  receptive fields. So that downstream reshape operations work properly, you
  should iterate first over receptive fields and then over inputs. In other
  words, you should have a loop that looks like this:

  next_col = 0
  for y0, y1, x0, x1 in field_coords(params):
    for i in xrange(num_inputs):
      cols[:, next_col] = [something]
      next_col += 1

  Inputs:
  - x: 4D array of shape (N, C, H, W). This should be interpreted as N
    independent inputs, each with height H, width W, and C channels.
  - field_height: Integer; height of each receptive field
  - field_width: Intger; width of each receptive field
  - padding: The number of pixels of zero-padding to apply to x before
    extracting receptive fields.
  - stride: The horizontal and vertical offsets between adjacent receptive
    fields.

  Returns:
  A 2D array where each column is a receptive field of one of the inputs.

  Perform an operation which is not quite the inverse of im2col that we need
  to efficiently compute the backward pass of a convolutional layer.

  Specifically, cols is a matrix where each column holds the data for a
  receptive field, and x_shape is a tuple giving the shape of the original 4D
  block of data from which cols was formed. We want to reshape the data in cols
  back to the shape given by x_shape; where multiple receptive fields overlap,
  we want to sum the corresponding elements of x_shape.

  As a simple example, we know that im2col with filter_height=filter_width=2,
  padding=0 and stride=2 would produce the following transformation:

  [1 2 3]               [1 2 4 5]
  [4 5 6]  --im2col-->  [2 3 5 6]
  [7 8 9]               [4 5 7 8]
                        [5 6 8 9]

  In contrast, col2im with the same parameters would produce the following:

  [a b c d]               [ a      e+b      f ]
  [e f g h]  --col2im-->  [i+c  m+j+k+g+d  n+h]
  [i j k l]               [ k      o+l      p ]
  [m n o p]

  To easily implement this, you can reuse the field_coords generator function.
  Make sure you iterate over receptive fields and then inputs as in im2col.

  If padding is nonzero, then col2im should throw away the portion of the
  reshaped array that corresponds to padding; in other words, the output
  of col2im should have shape equal to x_shape.

  - cols: Array where each column is a receptive field
